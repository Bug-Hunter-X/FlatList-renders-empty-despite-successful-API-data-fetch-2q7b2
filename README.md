# React Native FlatList Empty Render Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders empty even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The problem stems from how the FlatList handles updates when data is loaded asynchronously.  The solution provided addresses this by correctly managing component state and rendering.

## Problem

The `DataFetch.js` file contains a component that fetches data from a public API using `fetch`. Despite successful data retrieval, the FlatList remains empty. This is a common error when the data update occurs after the initial render.

## Solution

The `DataFetchSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation. The solution ensures that the FlatList only renders after the data has been successfully fetched and processed. It uses the `useEffect` hook for managing asynchronous operations and state updates.
